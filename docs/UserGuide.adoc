== Introduction

ɯeme is a meme manager app for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing memes*. More importantly, ɯeme is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ɯeme can let you manage memes faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `weme.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ɯeme.
